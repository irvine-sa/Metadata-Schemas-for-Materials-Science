# Metadata-Schemas-for-Materials-Science
*********************************************

The aim of this repository is to house the metadata schemas for different measurement techniques used in Materials Science. 
The schemas are written according to the XML Schema Definition (XSD) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
Sample files are also provided which are written according to the respective schemas.

## List of available Schemas:

1. Schema for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
  * [SEM_Schema.xsd](SEM_Schema.xsd)
  * [Example xml file written with the SEM schema](SEM_example.xml)
  * [Example xml file which is populated only with the required fields](SEM_example_minimum.xml)
  * [SEM_schema.json](SEM_schema.json)
  
2. Schema for transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
  * [TEM_schema.json](TEM_schema.json)
